# dataScienceFromScratch
My personal begginer playground with data science and deep learning. 

## Files description
### Root folder
* getTitles.py - titles grabber script, it takes newses from rss channels to .txt file
* removeDuplicate.ipynb - python script removing duplicate lines in txt file
* News_titles_stats_and_visualization.ipynb - intro into data visualization and statistics
### titlesBase - my tiny database to analyze
* titlesPL_with_duplicates.txt  - raw ~20k news title base from Poland grabbed everyday in July 2020, containing duplicates
* titlesPL_6k.txt - title.txt with purged duplicate lines, about ~6k news
## #Niusbot 2021
This project generates funny polish news titles variations. I'm using https://github.com/minimaxir/textgenrnn as base to workout on LSTM networks.
## News_titles_stats_and_visualization.ipynb
We're getting trend statistics and trying to visualize it there.
